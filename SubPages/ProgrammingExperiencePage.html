							<h2>Ciaran Cullens Experience with technology.</h2>

							<p>I first learned about programming when I went to university. I studied games programming in SAE institute, which is a branch university from Middlesex meaning that the degree is credited from Middlesex. As the course I did was accelerated to 2 years of learning I had to learn fast. In my time at university, I learned how to program in C++ and C#. Programming projects include a text-based game, multiplayer 2D game, Mobile game, VR Game and creating a plugin for unreal engine. Soft skill projects included where Online marketing and project management, marketing, business planning and law, Research practice and society.</a></p>

							<p>While in university I had a work experience opportunity in a company called WellTel who deals in telecoms. While at WellTel I learned how to use a Linux laptop and how to setup servers to run programs that I have created. The task that I was designated while on work experience was to get the users contacts from google and port it over to their work phone so that when someone rings up the company, they will know who is ringing and be able to answer with a “hello betty” to close the gap between our customer and their customers.</a></p>

							<p>After university I really wanted to be a games developer but sadly I didn’t have the proper technical skills to go straight into that role, so when a friend of mine suggested opening up to other options I did. I then started work with Sparta global. I was in a class to learn to be a C# software developer in testing (SDET). The training took 10 weeks and we learned in order: Soft skills, listening and communication, SQL Query, C# fundamentals, WPF game, Agile/Scrum, ASP.NET MVC, ISTQB Foundation, API testing, Selenium and SpecFlow. Unfortunally for me Sparta took on too many students and didn’t have enough clients for half the class that included me.</a></p>

							<p>After the setback at Sparta global I was able to obtain a junior developer consultant role at AKKA. The role was supposed to start in March 2020 with learning the ADA programming language in a week-long course. Unfortunally COVID-19 was around and the training had to be put on hold as I would need to travel from London to Bristol. I was told to wait a month, then another month until after 4 to 5 months I was told that unfortunally they couldn’t afford to hire me properly. While I was waiting, I was going through YouTube tutorials for ADA programming so that it would be easier to start work as I had never encountered ADA before.</a></p>
							<p>Now we are at the present where I keep my programming skills sharp with tutorials on YouTube and hackerrank. But I have now an opportunity with Tech returners to learn new programming skills to develop me for the next step in my career.</a></p>
